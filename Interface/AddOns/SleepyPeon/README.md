# SleepyPeon

A simple, lightweight and standalone replacement of the classic XP bar for Turtle WoW. Its primary function is to provide a display of the rest XP in cases when it
exceeds the original XP bar bounds.

Since rest XP is plentiful through tents, I find that it is useful to know: **1) how much the rest XP is filled up** and 
**2) to what extent it fills up into the upcoming levels**. <br/>

Of course, there are a number of addons that track rest xp in one way or another (such as RestedXP and pfUI among others). But they are either not standalone
or fail to provide the same information at a glance. 

This addOn tries to accomplish both points **1)** and **2)** while being fairly *lightweight* and supplying relevant rest XP information in a *simple* manner.


### Features:
- Dynamically tracks rest xp into successive character levels
- Right Click to show options; currently there is an option to lock/unlock and another to replace it to its default position 
- Left Click to drag the bar when unlocked
- Mouseover to display a tooltip with quantity of rest xp and percentage of current level xp cap(maxes at 150%)
